            | First, create an account to become part of the CitizensOrg community. Then, go to your organize dashboard and post about events, meetings,  
            | or actions you'd like to organize. If facilitating isn't your thing, you can find an event to join! 
            | CitizensOrg creates an online meeting place where individuals can create, or join, actions to facilitate political organizing.

            | As a group of concerned citizens, we recognized the need to have a central place where concerned individuals can find information 
            | to stay politically informed and active. With focus on building a movement to take back Congress from Republicans in 2018, CitizensOrg 
            | members will maintain pressure on the current administration until itâ€™s time to vote!

          p#description
            | We are a mix of graduate and undergraduate Computer Science students at Mills College in Oakland, CA. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, we wanted to
            | create some agency around being politically active in our communities; hence the creation of this website!
