            | CitizensOrg creates an online meeting place where individuals can create actions to facilitate political organization. As a group of concerned citizens, we recognize the need for individuals to have a central place where they can find information that helps them stay informed and politically active.With focus on building a movement to take back Congress from Republicans in 2018, CitizensOrg will maintain pressure on the current administration until itâ€™s time to vote!
