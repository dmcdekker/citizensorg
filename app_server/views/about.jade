            | First, create an account to become part of the CitizensOrg community. Then, make posts about events, meetings,  
            | or actions, you'd like to organize. If facilitating isn't your thing, you can find an event to join! 
            | CitizensOrg creates an online meeting place where individuals can create actions to facilitate political organizing.

            | As a group of concerned citizens, we recognize the need for individuals to have a central place where they can find information 
            | to stay informed and politically active. With focus on building a movement to take back Congress from Republicans in 2018, CitizensOrg 
            | will maintain pressure on the current administration until itâ€™s time to vote!

            | We are Computer Science students at Mills College in Oakland, CA. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, we wanted to
            | create some agency around being politically active in our communities; hence the creation of this website!
